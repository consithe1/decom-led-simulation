# decom-led-simulation

## Description
This project is to simulate LED strips and run sequences in order to visualise them before implementing them IRL.

## Functionalities
- Import an image
- Import an existing simulation
- Save a simulation
- Draw on a canvas
  - Draw referential line
  - Draw LED lines
- Generate LED strips based on lines drawn
- Parameters
  - LED size (in px)
  - LED density (in LEDs/m)

## To implement
- LED sequences
- simulation import verifications
- closing simulation
